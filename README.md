I love programming because I think it's magical - with some lines of code, we can create powerful applications from scratch. Coding is challenging yet super fun and rewarding. There's always more to learn.

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects, reading programming books, and building my own mini-apps. I also love playing strategy games, which complements my logical thinking as a programmer.

Let's connect if you also believe programming is more like an art! I'd be happy to chat about the latest tech, collaboration opportunities or just geek out over code.
